      <description>Created a tool that predicts (with an RMSLE score of 0.399) the sale price of bulldozers given its previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for. Based only on the model trained on a smaller portion of data than those in the leaderboard, we would place on the 91th position, thus earning a bronze medal ðŸ¥‰. Trained models on a sample of around 400,000 examples with 50+ features (time series data with sale examples up to 2011).</description>

      <description>Created a tool that predicts (with an accuracy ~ 84.46%) if someone has heart disease to help medical professionals diagnose potential dangers based on a patient&amp;rsquo;s clinical parameters. Trained models on a sample of 242 patient records and tested them on a testing set of 61 records. Experimented with LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier. Based on baseline models, optimizations were done for LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV in order to reach the best model.</description>
